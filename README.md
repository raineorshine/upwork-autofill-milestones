A chrome extension that autofills milestones from JSON into an [Upwork](https://upwork.com/) offer.

Works well with [github-milestone-groups](https://github.com/raineorshine/github-milestone-groups/).

```js
[
  { "issues": [2128, 2144, 2093, 2110, 2111], "hours": 24, "due": "2024-08-12" },
  { "issues": [2129, 2142, 1660], "hours": 28, "due": "2024-09-02" },
  { "issues": [1955, 2054], "hours": 40, "due": "2024-09-23" },
]
```
